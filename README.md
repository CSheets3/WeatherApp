This is a simple weather app.
It will show you the weather at your current location (if you enable your location) and will display the timezone that you're currently in.
It will also show you an automated Icon along with the type of weather (Rainy, Cloudy, etc).
The degrees are in Farenheit for now and later I will upload a cursor click for you to switch it to Celcius.
